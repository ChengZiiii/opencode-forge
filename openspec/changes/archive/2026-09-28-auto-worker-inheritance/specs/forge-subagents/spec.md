# forge-subagents delta — auto-worker-inheritance

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Static agent definitions in a dedicated forge.json

Subagents SHALL be configured in a dedicated `forge.json` (JSONC — comments allowed), resolved by a two-level cascade with a single winning source (no merging): project `<project>/.opencode/forge.json` (versionable, team-shared) over global `~/.config/opencode/forge.json`. The file SHALL define `agents` as a map of agent id (`[a-z0-9-]`) to `{model?, thoughtLevel?, prompt?, shape?, permission?}` where `model` and `thoughtLevel` form an atomic configuration pair: both absent defines an **Auto worker** — the materialized agent carries no `model` key and inherits the parent session's model through the host's native spawn behavior, with no depth injected (the provider default applies); both present defines a **pinned worker** — `model` is the exact `provider/model` identity pinned into the materialized agent and `thoughtLevel` is a pinned reasoning word (canonical `none|low|medium|high|max` or a native level name, verbatim); exactly one of the two present — in either direction, including `thoughtLevel` without `model` — makes the entry invalid: it SHALL be skipped with an error finding naming the agent id and the missing half, while its siblings still apply. The legacy `depths` array SHALL be ignored with a deprecation finding and SHALL NOT influence behavior. Configuration SHALL hot-apply: the plugin re-reads the file (mtime-cached) at every config hook and every depth-injection lookup, so edits take effect without a host restart. The plugin SHALL only ever READ this file — never create, write, or migrate it. When no forge.json exists the unconfigured state SHALL be inert: no subagents registered, no errors raised, no AI-facing configuration recipe emitted; onboarding lives in the README for the human operator.

#### Scenario: Project file wins over global

- **WHEN** both `<project>/.opencode/forge.json` and `~/.config/opencode/forge.json` exist
- **THEN** the project file fully determines the agent set; the global file is not merged in

#### Scenario: Edits hot-apply without restart

- **WHEN** the user edits `forge.json` on a running host and the next config hook fires
- **THEN** the materialized agent set and depth lookups reflect the new file content; no host restart is required

#### Scenario: The plugin never writes the file

- **WHEN** any plugin lifecycle event occurs (load, config hook, chat.params, error)
- **THEN** `forge.json` is only read; the plugin never generates, completes, or migrates it

#### Scenario: Legacy depths field degrades to a finding

- **WHEN** an agent definition carries `depths: ["low", "medium"]` alongside a pinned `model` + `thoughtLevel` pair
- **THEN** the agent still materializes on the pinned pair, a deprecation finding naming the agent is recorded, and the `depths` array does not influence behavior

#### Scenario: Unconfigured state is inert

- **WHEN** the host starts with no forge.json anywhere in the cascade
- **THEN** no `forge-*` subagents are registered, no error or recipe is surfaced to the model, and the host behaves exactly as without this capability

#### Scenario: An Auto worker entry is valid

- **WHEN** an agent definition carries neither `model` nor `thoughtLevel`
- **THEN** the entry is accepted with no error finding and materializes as an Auto worker (no `model` key on the materialized agent; the parent session's model applies at dispatch; the provider's default depth applies)

#### Scenario: A half-configured entry is rejected in both directions

- **WHEN** one entry defines `model` without `thoughtLevel`, and another defines `thoughtLevel` without `model`
- **THEN** both entries are skipped with an error finding each naming the agent id and the missing half, and the remaining entries still apply

### Requirement: Materialization as native subagents with a pinned model

The config hook SHALL materialize each configured agent as a `mode: subagent` agent `forge-<id>` that is visible to the host's native `task` tool vocabulary (discoverable by the model, excluded from the Tab cycle by its subagent mode), a prompt composed of the worker discipline wrapped around the role prompt, and a deny-style permission: `shape: "readonly"` (the default) denies mutating tools, `shape: "write"` allows them, an explicit `permission` map overrides the shape-derived default — and every agent SHALL deny `task` regardless (recursive spawning stays physically impossible). A pinned entry's materialized agent SHALL carry the definition's pinned `model` (the brain is bound at materialization — there is no per-call model selection); an Auto entry's materialized agent SHALL carry no `model` key at all, deferring to the host's native spawn behavior — the parent session's current model binds at dispatch time (snapshot semantics: later primary model switches do not affect already-dispatched runs). The task-vocabulary description SHALL name the role and, for a pinned entry, the pinned brain; an Auto entry's description SHALL state that it inherits the parent session's model instead of claiming a pinned identity. The worker discipline embedded in the prompt SHALL mandate workspace-relative paths only (never absolute paths outside the workspace), verbatim reporting of tool refusals instead of improvising workarounds, and conclusions carrying evidence references; readonly agents are additionally told to report rather than work around restrictions. Materialization SHALL be create-only: a user-defined entry of the same id is never touched (identically under the v2 `setup` entry point, which registers the same agents on a create-only basis). When `agent["forge"].disable` is set no subagents SHALL be registered.

#### Scenario: Agent entries carry the pinned model

- **WHEN** the plugin loads with a forge.json defining `research: {model: "prov/x", thoughtLevel: "low"}` and the injected agent set is inspected
- **THEN** `forge-research` is a subagent-mode agent whose `model` is exactly `prov/x`, listed for the native task tool, with a deny-style permission including `task: deny`

#### Scenario: An Auto worker materializes without a model key

- **WHEN** the plugin loads with a forge.json defining `scout: {}` (no `model`, no `thoughtLevel`) and the injected agent set is inspected
- **THEN** `forge-scout` is a subagent-mode agent with no `model` field, listed for the native task tool, with the same deny-style permission including `task: deny`, and a description that names inheritance rather than a pinned identity

#### Scenario: The materialized prompt embeds the discipline

- **WHEN** the composed prompt of a materialized agent is inspected
- **THEN** it contains the workspace-relative-path mandate and the verbatim-refusal-reporting mandate, wrapped around the agent's role prompt (explicit `prompt` overriding the built-in role default)

#### Scenario: A permission override keeps the recursion ban

- **WHEN** an agent sets `permission: {"bash": "deny"}` with `shape: "write"`
- **THEN** the materialized permission honors the override and still carries `task: deny`

#### Scenario: A user-defined agent entry is never clobbered

- **WHEN** the user has their own `agent["forge-research"]` configuration (v1 or v2 loader)
- **THEN** the plugin skips injection for that id and the user's entry stands

#### Scenario: The disable knob registers nothing

- **WHEN** `agent["forge"].disable: true` is set
- **THEN** no `forge-*` subagents are registered alongside the other plugin silences

### Requirement: Field-level fail-soft validation

forge.json parsing SHALL degrade semantically invalid content at the smallest enclosing level rather than discarding the file: a syntactically broken document (invalid JSONC) yields the empty agent set plus an error finding; an agent entry whose `model`/`thoughtLevel` pair is half-configured — exactly one of the two present after field-type normalization, in either direction, or a present `model`/`thoughtLevel` of the wrong type — is skipped with an error finding while its siblings still apply. Findings SHALL be surfaced through the plugin's diagnostics channel and never silently swallowed; no fallback seed agents exist in any failure path.

#### Scenario: One bad entry does not disable its siblings

- **WHEN** forge.json defines two agents and one has `model` but no `thoughtLevel`
- **THEN** the valid agent materializes normally and an error finding names the skipped one and its missing half

#### Scenario: Broken JSON empties the set with an error finding

- **WHEN** the winning forge.json fails JSONC parsing
- **THEN** no agents are registered and an error finding carries the parse location — the built-in seed is never resurrected

#### Scenario: A mistyped optional field costs only itself

- **WHEN** an agent pins `model: "prov/x"` but defines `thoughtLevel: 3` (a number)
- **THEN** the mistyped field counts as absent for the atomic-pair check, so the entry is skipped with an error finding — the cost is confined to that entry, and its siblings still materialize
